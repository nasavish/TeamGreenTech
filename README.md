Project Title: Solar Adoption Analysis for New York State Between 2000 and 2017. 

Team Members: Dipesh, Josh, Aubrey, Vish

Project Description/ Outline: 
conduct an analysis on solar energy projects w/in New York to determine (1) how solar adoptin has evolved over time, (2) how the associated costs have changed, (3) what the relationship is between several SEC factors and solar penetration within various zipcodes, (4) whether or not these solar adoption changes are correlated w/ the introduction of finacial innovations and (5) how Twitter users feel about the top 10 solar panel contractors in NY state.
