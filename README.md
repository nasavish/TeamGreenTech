UCB DATA  - team project 1

1) Project Title: Solar Adoption Analysis for New York State Between 2000 and 2017. 

2) Team Members: Dipesh, Josh, Aubrey, Vish

3) Project Description/ Outline: 
To conduct an analysis on solar energy projects w/in New York to determine (1) how solar adoption has evolved over time, (2) how the associated costs have changed, (3) what the relationship is between several socio-economic (SEC) factors and solar penetration within various zipcodes, (4) whether or not these solar adoption changes are correlated w/ the introduction of finacial innovations and (5) a sentiment analysis re: how social media users feel about the top 10 solar panel contractors in NY. 

4) Reserach Questions to Answer:
- How has the penetration of solar energy evolved over time (display this as a heat map) for residential, non-residential, and utility scale solar energy projects?
- How has the cost of solar energy changed over time w/ and w/o incentives?
- How are income levels related to solar penetration? (group by home owners vs non-home owners, race/ other SEC factors, etc.)
- Did solar adoption change with the introduction of financial innovations (lease/ppa versus own)?
- How do Twitter users feel about the top 10 solar contractors w/in New York?

5) Data Sets to be Used:
- Twitter API
- Solar installation data (data.ny.gov)
- US Census Bureau Data

6) Rough Breakdown of Tasks: TBD (6/23/18)
